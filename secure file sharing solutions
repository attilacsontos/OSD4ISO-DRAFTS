Secure File-Sharing Solutions Developed in the EU for Freelancers

1.	What is file-sharing software?
File-sharing software is a type of application or platform that allows users to upload, store, and exchange files over the Internet. It enables individuals or businesses to share documents, images, videos, and other digital content quickly and securely with others. File-sharing software can be cloud-based, where files are stored on remote servers, or peer-to-peer, where files are directly transferred between users' devices.
These applications typically offer a range of features designed to streamline the process of sharing files. For example, some allow users to generate links that others can use to download or view the files, while others may offer real-time collaboration features, such as editing documents together or leaving comments. Some platforms also include encryption to protect the contents of files during transmission, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.
In addition to standard file sharing, many modern platforms also provide advanced features like version control, where users can keep track of different versions of a file, or access permissions, where file owners can control who can view, edit, or download the content. The ability to set expiration dates on shared links, password-protect files, and track download activity adds another layer of security and control.
