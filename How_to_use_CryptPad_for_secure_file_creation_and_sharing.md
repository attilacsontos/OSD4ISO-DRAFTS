# How to use CryptPad for secure file creation and sharing?

In the article Secure File-Sharing Solutions Developed in the EU for Freelancers, we discussed the available solutions on the market and the importance of using secure, open-source file-sharing applications developed in the EU.

Among the platforms mentioned was CryptPad, which we explore further in this article. This serves as a step-by-step guide on how to use CryptPad, its features, and the benefits it offers.

## 1.	What is CryptPad?

CryptPad is a secure, privacy-focused collaboration suite that enables real-time document editing, file sharing, and communication without compromising data security. CryptPad uses end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only users with the correct access can read or modify content. With tools for text documents, spreadsheets, kanban boards, and presentations, CryptPad offers a full-featured workspace designed to protect sensitive information.

## 2.	Why should freelancers use CryptPad?

Freelancers often handle confidential client data, contracts, and project plans. CryptPad ensures that sensitive information stays private, as even the platform itself cannot access stored files. Unlike conventional cloud services that may collect and analyze user data, CryptPad prioritizes anonymity and security. It also allows freelancers to collaborate with clients without requiring them to create accounts, streamlining workflow and improving efficiency.

### 2.1.	 What are the benefits of CryptPad for freelancers?

* **Data privacy**: End-to-end encryption ensures that your files, contracts, and client documents remain confidential.
* **No account requirement**: Clients or collaborators can access shared content via a link without signing up.
* **No ads or tracking**: CryptPad does not monetize user data, making it a safer alternative to corporate office suites.
* **Collaboration tools**: Multiple users can edit and comment on documents in real time, making it ideal for project coordination.
* **Self-hosting option**: Advanced users can host CryptPad on their own server for complete data control.

## 3.	What is the importance of CryptPad being open source?
As an open-source platform, CryptPad’s code is transparent and publicly available, allowing security experts to audit and verify its safety. This ensures there are no hidden vulnerabilities or backdoors that could compromise user data. Open-source software also fosters innovation, as developers worldwide can contribute improvements and expand functionality. For freelancers, this means long-term reliability and trust in a platform that prioritizes us er control over corporate interests.

## 4.	How does CryptPad work?

CryptPad encrypts all user data in the browser before sending it to the server. This means that even the platform’s operators cannot see or access the stored files. When you create a document or upload a file, CryptPad generates a unique, encrypted URL that acts as the key to access the content. Only those who receive this link can view or edit the document, ensuring complete control over data privacy.

The platform includes a variety of collaborative tools, such as:

* **Rich text documents** for writing and editing content.
* **Spreadsheets** for data organization and calculations.
* **Kanban boards** for task and project management.
* **Whiteboards** for brainstorming and visual collaboration.
* **Code editor** for developers working on scripts or software.
* **File storage and sharing** with encrypted uploads.

Users can work on documents in real time with teammates or clients, all without requiring an account to access shared files.

## 5. A brief introduction to the user interface

The best way to get familiar with the application is to read its documentation at **[CryptPad documentation](https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/)**. There are three detailed guides: User Guide, Administrator Guide, and Developer Guide.

### 5.1. What are the benefits of becoming a logged-in user?

Creating a CryptPad account requires only a username and password, with no personal information needed. Logged-in users gain access to permanent document storage, file uploads, and enhanced document management features such as password protection, expiration dates, and access control. 

Documents can be organized into folders, shared spaces, or tagged for easy access. Users can also create teams, customize their profile page, manage contacts, receive notifications, and collaborate via chat. Additionally, CryptPad offers calendar creation and management for better workflow organization.

Because of the benefits described above, you may want to sign up and create an account. After clicking the "Sign up" button in the top right-hand corner, you will be directed to the registration page. Please read the ‘Important notes’ section on the left: to remember your password is very important, this is the secret key that encrypts all of your documents and if you lose it there is no way CryptPad can recover your data.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_b95281306e5b99426dadf31d0df250ff.png)

At Cryptpad, they think it seriously, since once you populate the fields and give your username and password, they remind you again that they cannot recover it for you.

### 5.2. A short description of the CryptDrive user interface

Once you have written down your login credentials and clicked the red button, you will be directed to the Cryptpad drive, CryptDrive:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_3642bb87064b393dd64afed5e4173429.png)

The functions numbered in the screenshot above are described as follows:

1.	**Drive icon**: Navigate to the CryptPad homepage at any time by clicking here. This section of the screen changes based on your current location within the application. For instance, when you are in the Settings area, a gear icon will appear. By clicking the gear icon, you can easily return to your CryptDrive home screen.

2.	**Notifications**: You can see a bell icon with a number next to it. The number represents how many notifications you have.

Click the ‘+New’ link so the following popup window opens:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_45c8b961ebc367c522cbff511dfe737e.png)

You can create folders, subfolders, shared folders (you can password protect them), and you can organise them the way you like:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_266634ee65f64dfe224b3e05e9e857fb.png)

Please note that, in addition to creating folders and shared folders, you can also create and upload various types of files using this functionality.

16.	**Donate**: By using the Donate button on the CryptDrive homepage, you will be directed to the Open Collective page. There, you can find a detailed list of financial contributors and choose from different membership levels by donating a varying amount each month.

You can support CryptPad by making a one-time or recurring donation through their Open Collective website. There are also several non-financial ways to contribute.

## 6. How can you send files securely with CryptPad?

Freelancers often need to share sensitive files, such as contracts, invoices, or project materials, without exposing them to security risks. CryptPad provides a secure way to send files while maintaining privacy.

After a brief introduction to the user interface, let's look at a practical example of how we can send files securely using CryptPad. There are two options as follows:

### 6.1. The person to whom you want to share a file is not a CryptPad logged-in user

You send a link to someone who can use it to download the file. You can password-protect the file and maintain a secure communication channel outside of CryptPad to stay in touch and communicate.

The steps to send files securely using CryptPad are as follows:

**1. Upload your file**

* Go to CryptPad’s Files app.
* Upload the file you want to share.

**2.	Generate a secure link**

* Once uploaded, CryptPad will provide a unique, encrypted link to your file.
* The encryption key is embedded in the link, so only those with the link can access it.

**3.	Set access permissions (optional)**

* Choose whether recipients can only view the file or also edit it.
* Set an expiration time for additional security (e.g., file access expires after a day).

**4.	Share the link securely**

* Send the link via a secure communication channel (avoid email if possible; use encrypted messaging services like Signal or Matrix).
* Inform the recipient that the link contains the decryption key and should not be shared with unauthorized persons.

**5.	Delete or revoke access when needed**

* CryptPad allows users to delete files or revoke access when they are no longer needed.

### 6.2. The person to whom you want to share a file is a CryptPad logged-in user

In this case, you invite someone and add them as a contact within CryptPad. This is a more secure way of working on a file, as you do not need to leave CryptPad to communicate. You can even chat within the application, making the process more secure and simple.

## 7. How can you upload your file?

Go to ‘Files’ and click the ‘+’ sign.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_d1c1c4b470c1bea008494bc5e0c65d01.png)

Then click the option ‘Upload files’ and choose the file you want to upload.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_37c2e3af943727ec5abf04f4f592f578.png)

A popup window appears with the selected file name automatically populated. You can add descriptive text, which is helpful when you have many files uploaded and do not want to open them to understand their contents. 

You can also password-protect your file. The "Owned file" checkbox is checked by default, and if you hover your mouse over the question mark icon, a short description will appear explaining what that functionality is about.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_f2b11736607d2a5eb3e24834094fed4a.png)

The uploaded file appears in the user interface. In the top left-hand corner of the icon, you can see a lock icon indicating that the file is password-protected, as well as an icon showing that the file is "owned" (you are the owner of the file).

For the shared folder icon (to the left of the highlighted and circled icon), two icons are visible, indicating that you are the owner of the folder and that ownership is shared.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_bf9341eb70f58e1c7c474a5b7b791252.png)

## 8. How to generate a secure link?

Right-click the file you want to share and choose the option ‘Share’ from the menu that appears on the right.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_8563652064630ed3a79b4975c5b09416.png)

A popup window appears with three tabs as follows: Contacts, Link, and Embed. Since we do not have any contacts yet, we can use the Link functionality instead of the Contacts option. The link to the document is displayed at the top of the window. You can easily copy the link with a single click on the "Copy Link" button.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_57db7d8e0f0cce979fbdab05785a6acf.png)

The Link tab provides a link that can be shared through your preferred medium. Depending on how you send the link, this method may present security risks. To add an extra layer of security, it is recommended to set a password for your document before sharing the link.

When someone receives the link to the document but has not registered on CryptPad yet (first scenario), they will see the following screen (in this case the person is not a CryptPad user):

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_88b399f39cd297f68cb206faf19df693.png)

But what if the person with whom you want to share your file is a CryptPad user (second scenario)?

Due to the security concerns mentioned above, sharing files with contacts is the recommended method for securely sharing documents on CryptPad. When sharing directly with contacts, document links never leave CryptPad’s encrypted platform, preventing data from being exposed to third parties.

To test this, I registered a different account on CryptPad (**JO** stands for Joe), logged in again, and shared my profile (**CS**) with a newly created second account. Please read the following chapter to see how it works.

## 9. How to share your profile?

To share your profile, first click on your 'User menu' icon in the top right-hand corner, then select the 'Profile' option from the list.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_37366fb9a472e567cc6f00c9f2bc0197.png)

Finally, as the third step, click on ‘Share’ and send the link to your future contact.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_c09a656a99336b95587a15dcfe5e7f77.png)

If the person to whom you sent the link (**JO**) does not have a CryptPad account yet, they will see a screen similar to the following:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_add71a2b1703a5dc18d5f2feb8120c60.png)

CryptPad created them a ‘Guest’ account and requests them to either log in or sign up to Cryptpad. Also, CryptPad informs them that they should add this user (my username is pixelated) to their contacts. 

Let’s log in and add this user to my second account (JO). Once I logged in, I could see that I should send a contact request to the user who sent me a document:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_53a8dd8d188a4fb2eb37cfce1e2b2049.png)

Once I clicked the "Send [username] a contact request" button, the button colour changed to grey, and its label updated to "Contact request pending…".

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_45e487dbec81b22ffb3027c31155884b.png)

Now, let me log back to my account (**CS**). After logging in, the only thing that shows that I received a contact request is the number next to the notification bell changing from two to three. After clicking on the bell, the drop-down menu shows that a user named Joe sent me a contact request. 

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_974e544ca2b8134d2a4f5caef375497b.png)

Since I know Joe, I clicked on the request and accepted it.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_41c20e41612044d8fbee1b348647f2ee.png)

Now, I can check that Joe is my contact. Go to the user menu and click ‘Contacts’ from the list:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_358526b791925c20dd977316da9d4aca.png)

Once I click the "Contacts" link, I can see that I have a contact named Joe. With the crossed-out bell icon (numbered 1), I can mute my contact, while the person icon with an X on the right (numbered 2) allows me to remove Joe from my contacts.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_8f6dc4578b36e3cedf9254f74176eb6f.png)

## 10. How to share a document with a contact?

Go to your CryptDrive, right-click the document you want to share, and choose the option ‘Share’:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_239317049534ff59c810600b0b9b9aab.png)

The Contacts tab becomes active on the ‘Share with contacts’ screen. Choose the contact you want to share with your document (or search among your contacts by name if you have many contacts). Once the contact is chosen, click the ‘Share’ button in the lower right-hand corner:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_c11d26cd3d99ec00e8531b0369e84c94.png)

Let’s switch between accounts again and log in as Joe. I received two notifications. One informs me that the user **CS** has accepted my contact request, and the other notifies me that **CS** has shared the file 'What is CryptPad.docx' with me.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_b12ee4cb8e218dead061940065bc8278.png)

If I click on the second notification, the file page opens. From there, I can either store the file on CryptDrive or download it to my local computer.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_2fd9e5cf4b2d0779363bb5c83089f0a4.png)

Let’s choose to store the file on CryptDrive and click the ‘Store’ button. Once we navigate to CryptDrive, we can see that the file is indeed in our drive. Right-click the file and open it as a Word document.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_8605854d0d1f20ec3d32e3f12294612f.png)

The file opens, and in the top right-hand corner, we can see the logged-in user (JO). Beneath that, it shows that this user is currently editing the document. At the top centre of the screen, options are available to share the document with others or adjust its access rights. The user interface is very similar to Microsoft Word.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_f69cee2364de99ec91087347f34e49f0.png)

The workflow described above is format-independent, meaning that for all other fire types, similar steps must be followed according to the workflow described above.
