# Why and what kind of VPN individuals and small organisations should use?

In the past, VPNs were mainly used by companies to allow employees to securely connect to the corporate network from anywhere.

Today, VPN is a widespread and popular security policy even in ordinary households, which guarantees people a certain degree of privacy and protection.

Individuals and small organizations working remotely face many cybersecurity challenges and must respond appropriately to these threats. The many challenges can be answered with many tools and methods, one of them is the use of a VPN.

## 1. What is a VPN?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service that establishes a secure, encrypted connection across a less secure network, usually the Internet. A VPN creates a securely encrypted Internet connection to your business's private network over the public Internet.

Using a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through a secure tunnel, ensuring your online activity remains private. This safeguards your personal information and communications, even when you're connected to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.

## 2. Why do you need a VPN?

You need to use a VPN because a VPN hides your IP address before connecting to the Internet and uses its own instead, ensuring your anonymity.

Without using a VPN, your hosting provider assigns you an IP address, but with that comes the risk of privacy violations - many websites store these IP addresses along with information about them (and information about you!) in their database, causing the user to lose some degree of anonymity.

In addition, there are further arguments for using VPN as described below.

### 2.1. Using a VPN provides increased security in two ways

A VPN **encrypts your internet connection**, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and access sensitive data. This is especially important if you are working with confidential customer data or financial records.

Moreover, it **gives you protection on public Wi-Fis**: if you often work from cafes, co-working spaces, or other locations with public Wi-Fi, a VPN helps protect your data from potential threats on these unsecured networks.

### 2.2.	Using a VPN is very important to achieve adequate data protection

It offers the necessary **anonymity**: A VPN masks your IP address, making it harder for websites, advertisers, or any third parties to track your online activities. This is crucial for maintaining privacy in your business operations.

Without using a VPN, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can monitor your online activity. A VPN **hides your browsing data from your ISP**, ensuring that your business activities remain private.

### 2.3. Using a VPN gives you access to geo-restricted content

A VPN enables you to access services and websites that may be blocked or restricted in your location by making it appear as though you are browsing from a different region. This is particularly useful when working with international clients or to access content that is otherwise unavailable in your area.

### 2.4. By using a VPN, you can meet certain customer requirements and security standards

Some customers or industries may require you to use a VPN to meet data security standards. Using a VPN shows professionalism and a commitment to protecting customer data.

### 2.5. By using a VPN, you may even avoid bandwidth limitations from your ISP

Without using a VPN, your ISP can track which websites you visit and how much data you consume on each website. If, in the opinion of the service provider, you are using too much data, it can even reduce the speed of the Internet connection to limit the data traffic.

## 3. What kind of VPN you should use?

Based on the arguments listed in the previous chapter, it is easy to see that a VPN is an almost indispensable tool for small entrepreneurs and sole proprietors working remotely. If you have already decided that a VPN is necessary, the next step is to determine which features to consider when selecting one.

You can find many VPN products on the Internet. You should choose one based on its security features, performance, ease of use, reputation, and support. Also, consider using an open-source VPN.

### 3.1.	Security features

Perhaps one of the most important of these are the features of the security functions, among which strong encryption, no-logs policy, and the existence of a kill switch are essential.

Choose a VPN that offers at least AES-256 encryption (highly secure). Make sure that the VPN provider does not keep records of your online activities (does not log your activity), as this would undermine your right to anonymity and personal data protection.

The kill switch is important because it allows you to automatically disconnect yourself from the Internet when the VPN connection is lost, preventing the transmission of unprotected data.

### 3.2. Performance

Choose a VPN that offers fast and reliable servers, especially if you need to transfer large files or video conference a lot.

### 3.3. Ease of use

The VPN should be easy to set up and use with a simple user-friendly interface that does not require technical expertise.

### 3.4. Reputation

Choose a VPN from a well-known provider with positive reviews, good customer service, and a proven track record.

### 3.5. Support

Good customer service is vital, especially if you run into technical issues while working. Fast and efficient help minimizes idle time and improves your efficiency. Real humans available 24/7 on live chat support can make a significant difference from mail-based support.

If you work on multiple devices (e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet), look for a VPN that supports multiple simultaneous connections (multi-device support).

## 4. Types of VPNs

VPNs can be divided into two large groups, such as commercial VPNs and corporate VPNs.

### 4.1. Commercial VPNs

A commercial VPN (also called a consumer or personal VPN) connects you to a remote server or a group of servers, that interact with the public Internet on behalf of you. Since this article is primarily aimed at individuals, private entrepreneurs, and small businesses, the focus of this article is mainly on this type of VPN.

### 4.2. Corporate VPNs

A corporate or business VPN enables an organization’s remote employees to securely connect to the internet as if they were physically in the office. However, unlike commercial VPNs, corporate VPNs are designed to protect the company and not necessarily the individual's data.

## 5. Open- and closed-sourced VPNs

From another perspective, VPNs can be categorized into two types: open-source and closed-source. Since the OSD4ISO project primarily involves open-source options, we will focus more on discussing open-source VPNs, while briefly touching on closed-source VPNs.

### 5.1. Closed-source VPNs
With countless VPN service providers available online, finding the best one for your needs can be challenging. The following link is one of many that compares top VPNs (**[Top 10 VPNs of 2024](https://www.top10vpn.com/top10/free-trials/v/header/?bsid=c49huse1kw004&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIucz9zoKBiAMVopmDBx3gizPeEAAYAyAAEgJZovD_BwE)**), and the top 5 are as follows:

* **[ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/)**: Renowned for its robust security, high speed, and extensive global server network, it also features a strict no-logs policy and user-friendly interface.

* **[NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/)**: It provides robust security features, including CyberSec, which blocks ads and malware. Additionally, it is user-friendly and boasts a large server network.

### 5.2. Open-source VPNs

An open-source VPN is a VPN built and maintained by its community of users. This means that whenever someone discovers an enhancement, they share it with the other community members. While most open-source VPNs are free, some 

Open-source VPNs offer transparency, enabling you to review the code (if you have the expertise) and verify that there are no backdoors or vulnerabilities. Open-source VPNs can be more complicated to set up and often require a higher level of knowledge to maintain. Here are some of the best open-source VPN options:

* **[OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/)**: It is one of the most popular and widely used open-source VPN solutions. It is extremely secure, versatile, customizable, and you can set up your own VPN server. On the other hand, it can be complex to set up for beginners since it requires deep technical knowledge to configure.
* **[SoftEther VPN](https://www.softether.org/)**: It is a multi-protocol VPN that supports OpenVPN, L2TP/IPsec, and more. It is a flexible and powerful solution with very good speed. Its setup can be complex though and requires more resources than simpler VPNs like WireGuard.
* **[StrongSwan](https://www.strongswan.org/)**: IPsec-based (Internet Protocol Security) VPN solution that is very secure and supports a variety of authentication methods. It is actively maintained and documented with regular updates. On the other hand, it is difficult to set up and primarily focused on IPsec, which might not be right for you.
* **[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)**: it is a VPN protocol that was created to provide a faster, simpler, and easier-to-setup alternative to VPNs based on IPsec. It is relatively new and may not have as many features as more established protocols.
* **[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)**: Developed by the team behind ProtonMail, it focuses on privacy and security, with a strict no-logs policy and high-grade encryption.
* **[Mozilla VPN](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/)**: This VPN was developed by Mozilla. It is a very reliable open-source solution, it has more than 500 servers in 30+ countries and a very vivid community. 

## 6. Pros and cons of using open-source VPNs

In this chapter, let's briefly list the cons and pros of open-source VPNs.

### 6.1. Pros of using open-source VPNs

* **Cost-effectiveness**: Usually, there are no licensing fees, making it a budget-friendly option.
* **Transparency**: You can review their source code to ensure there are no security vulnerabilities or backdoors.
* **Customizability**: Open-source VPN solutions can be tailored to meet specific needs.
* **Community support**: Active communities often help with troubleshooting and updates

### 6.2. Cons of using open-source VPNs

* **Support**: In contrast to paid solutions, there may be no official customer service, but you can rely on social forums, and if the forum is not active, it will take a long time to get an answer.
* **Maintenance**: You are responsible for maintaining and updating the software to ensure ongoing security.
* **Complexity**: Setting up and configuring these VPNs can be challenging, especially for those without adequate technical expertise.
* **Non-active community**: If the source code is not updated regularly, corrections may not be made on time and the fixing of possible bugs may be delayed.

## 7. Limitations of VPNs (What VPNs are not for?)

Although VPNs offer great security when it comes to privacy and anonymity, they also have limitations.

### 7.1. VPNs cannot protect you against malware

VPNs cannot detect or remove malware. If you accidentally download a malicious file, your VPN will not prevent the malware from damaging your computer or stealing passwords, credit card details, photos and other sensitive data.

Some VPNs have a malware-blocking feature that only prevents you from visiting suspicious websites that might contain malware — but they do not stop actual malware from accessing your device. To ensure complete protection against malware, you should use anti-virus software developed for this purpose.

### 7.2. VPNs cannot ensure complete anonymity on the Internet

A VPN encrypts your data traffic on the Internet and changes your IP address, but they cannot provide you complete anonymity because websites use your browser's digital fingerprint to collect specific information about your computer, including language settings, operating system version, display resolution, time zone, and other information.

### 7.3. VPNs cannot prevent the use of cookies on websites

Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your computer when you visit a website and accept its cookie policy. Cookies have many functions, such as allowing you to be automatically logged in the next time you visit the same website. 

In addition, cookies save your preferences related to the given website (for example, which language setting you have chosen). However, websites can also use cookies to track what you do online and share your preferences with advertising companies.

VPNs cannot filter this out. To get rid of cookies, you must clear your browser's cache and cookies, use incognito/private mode in your browser, or install external browser extensions that block cookies.

### 7.4. Hide your real IP address from your ISP

A VPN can prevent websites from seeing your real IP address, but your ISP will still detect your IP address. The VPN connection works through the ISP's network, so the ISP will always see the VPN connection.

### 7.5. Encrypt activities on websites

VPNs encrypt the connection between you and the website, but they cannot encrypt what you do on the website. The owner of the website can still track what you type, upload or download on the site.

## 8. Conclusions

Using a VPN is essential for safeguarding your online activities, securing sensitive data, and preserving privacy while working remotely as a private entrepreneur. Select a VPN that matches your specific requirements, with a focus on security, performance, user-friendliness, and reliability.

Different VPNs offer various features and choosing among them can be challenging. Commercial VPNs are user-friendly but may involve privacy risks (some commercial VPNs may log user activity or share data with third parties). Additionally, if the VPN provider has weak security practices or a questionable privacy policy, users' data could be exposed. Corporate VPNs, on the other hand, provide robust security but can be costly. 

Open-source VPNs offer transparency and control, making them ideal for those who prioritize security and wish to avoid third-party risks. While open-source VPNs have advantages like transparency and control, they may not be suitable for everyone. Open-source VPNs can be challenging due to their technical complexity, requiring more knowledge to set up and maintain. They often lack dedicated customer support, relying instead on community help, which might not be sufficient. Users are responsible for updates and security, which can be time-consuming. 

Weighing the advantages and disadvantages, choose a reliable VPN with your own point of view in mind and use it every time you connect to the internet. The use of a VPN has certain limitations, but their advantages far exceed their possible limitations.
