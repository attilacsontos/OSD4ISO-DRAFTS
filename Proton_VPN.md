# Proton VPN – installation and set-up

## 1. Proton VPN

Although the Proton VPN page offers a wealth of useful information and links, the free version is very easy to locate on the Proton VPN website. 

If you do not see the free VPN link immediately, scroll to the bottom of the page, where it is conveniently placed in the footer. Clicking this link will take you to the [**Free VPN to Protect Your Privacy**](https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn) page, where you can download **[Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/)** for free.

Let’s see the steps one by one as follows:

### 1.1	 Create an account

You can choose where to install Proton VPN on your device. After clicking "Next," a popup appears, allowing you to decide whether to install additional Proton services such as ProtonMail, ProtonDrive, or ProtonPass. If you do not need any of these, simply uncheck the box next to the respective add-on. At this step, you can also choose to create a desktop shortcut for the app.

Once the installation is complete, the following screen will appear, allowing you to log in to Proton VPN. By default, the slider below the login enables automatic connection to the VPN server when you start your computer. This is a very handy option since you do not need to remember to connect to the VPN server whenever you turn on your computer.

### 1.3	Connect to a server

After a successful login, you will be directed to the Proton VPN portal page, which might indicate that you are not yet connected.

In that case, by clicking the "Quick Connect" button, you can connect to the nearest server with a single click.

You can easily disconnect from the server (click the button ‘Disconnect’) or change servers (use the Change server button).

From the country list in the lower-left corner of the screen, you can select the country you want to connect to on the Proton VPN server.

## 2. Proton VPN web client

The Proton Web client is a browser-based interface that allows you to access and manage Proton services, such as Proton Mail, Proton Drive, and Proton VPN, directly from your web browser. It enables you to use these services without needing to install dedicated apps, offering a convenient way to access your account and data from any device with internet access.

In case you choose ’Proton VPN’ from the product list above, you will be directed to the Proton VPN Portal so you can manage all your VPN-related actions.

Here, you can view your subscription type and the services it includes, and you can easily compare the differences between the free and the VPN Plus plans at a glance.
