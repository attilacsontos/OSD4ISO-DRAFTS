# TunnelBear VPN – installation and set up

**[TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/)** is a user-friendly VPN service designed to keep your online activity private and secure. With its simple interface and strong encryption, it helps protect your internet connection from prying eyes. 

TunnelBear also allows users to bypass geographic restrictions and access content from around the world, making it a solid option for anyone wanting a straightforward, reliable VPN experience. Plus, it offers a fun, bear-themed interface that makes using a VPN feel a little less technical.

## 1. Get a free version

To access the free version of TunnelBear, simply click the ‘Get TunnelBear’ button in the top-right corner, then select the free plan (Try for free) on the next screen.

Once you click on either ‘Try for Free’ or ‘Get Started’ (if you have selected a paid plan), the download icon will appear, indicating that the application is starting to download.

In addition, the website also says that the application download has started automatically:

Click the download icon and then run the .exe file:

The installer will launch and display the amount of space required for the application, how much space is available on your drive, and the location where the application will be downloaded. You can also choose to change the download location if needed.

The installer adds a playful touch by guiding you through each phase of the installation. First, it “unboxes your bear,” then it “brushes its fur,” and finally, it “cleans its paws” to get it ready for use.

## 2. Create a free account

Once the process is complete, the final screen allows you to create a free account by entering your email address and setting a password.

In the next step, you will be treated to a humorous animation—when you enter your password, the teddy bear playfully covers its eyes, adding a fun touch to the process.

## 3. Verify your email

As the next step, you need to verify your email address:

## 4. Connect to a VPN server

Once you verify your email, you will be directed to the VPN client. Since this is your first time opening the app, it has not connected to any of the servers yet.
You may click on the toggle button in the top left-hand corner, and with a single click, you will be connected to the nearest VPN server.

Your geographical position is marked with a sheep on the map. You may click on the ‘Settings’ button on the vertical tab and make further modifications.

## 5. Set TunnelBear the way you want

You may set Tunnelbear to launch automatically when you turn on your computer. This is a very useful feature and worth using. You can set your notifications and set up two-factor authentication:

When you switch the toggle ‘On’ you can also see a funny animation when a bear digs a hole and climbs into the pipe:

This is where you ‘enter’ into a VPN tunnel. In the next second, you can see which VPN server you are connected to, i.e. where the bear comes out of the pipe:

Of course, you may also choose which server you want to connect to. In most cases, the fastest connection is perfectly adequate. It is worth selecting a specific country from the list if you want to access content that can only be accessed from IP addresses in that region.

## 6. Disconnect from the VPN server

Once you finish working, click the toggle button and disconnect from the VPN server. The map greys out and the application asks how satisfied you were with its use.

## 7. Limitations of the free version

However, free usage has one important drawback: you can only use a total of 2000 megabytes of data per day, and you can see how much is left at the bottom of the screen. 

This data traffic is of course very small, but it is enough if you only want to use VPN for a very short time during your daily use. So it is worth considering joining Tunnelbear as a paid user: its ease of use, reliability and funny animations make it stand out from other VPN options.
